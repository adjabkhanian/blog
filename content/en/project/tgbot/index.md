# 📱 Telegram Bot for Field Tasks

**Project:** a smart Telegram bot that helps field teams efficiently complete tasks and report on them in just a few clicks.

---

## ❓ Why do you need this bot?

Many companies face problems like:  
- 🚫 Tasks get lost, employees forget to report  
- 📉 Managers find it hard to track task status  
- 🕒 Photo reports are collected manually and slowly  

**Solution:** a bot that handles it all. Simple, fast, and clear.

## ⚙️ How does it work?

1. 👤 Employee starts `/start`, selects their **role** and enters their name  
2. 🔘 Gets a **“Go to tasks”** button  
3. 🗺️ Selects a **region** (e.g., “North” or “Center”)  
4. 📋 Sees a task list:  
   - 🔧 Fix the network  
   - 📶 Install Wi-Fi  
5. 📸 Clicks “Complete task” and sends a **photo report**  
6. 🤖 Bot:  
   - saves the photo and executor’s name  
   - 💾 **updates Airtable**  
   - sends “✅ Task completed”  
   - automatically returns to region selection

## 📊 Airtable as a database

Uses an Airtable base where:  
- 🗂️ Tasks are stored by roles and locations  
- 📸 Photos and executor names are saved  
- ✔️ Status updates after task completion  

Integration via API — everything happens automatically.
